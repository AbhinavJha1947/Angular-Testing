Types of Testing in Angular

Angular mainly supports 3 levels of testing:

Type	Purpose	.NET Analogy
Unit Testing	Test a class/function in isolation	xUnit / NUnit
Component Testing	Test component + template	MVC Controller + View test
E2E Testing	Test full app flow in browser	Selenium / Playwright


Tools Used in Angular Testing
🔹 Default Angular Stack

Jasmine → Test framework (describe, it, expect)

Karma → Test runner (runs tests in browser)

TestBed → Angular’s DI + testing environment

🔹 Modern Alternatives (Recommended)

Jest → Faster unit tests

Cypress / Playwright → E2E testing
